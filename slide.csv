Many students had rooms with local families, but took their meals at the Union.  The University Club in the Union was always busy with faculty dining and activities.  The large and small Union ballrooms have always hosted events, including wedding receptions.  The Union helped to feed World War II soldiers in training, and for many years it hosted the training table for the U­M football team.  In the 1960’s, the Union sported a swimming pool, a barber shop, and even a bowling alley in the basement.  Today, the Union is no longer as central to campus life, but still plays many important roles for the University.",U
